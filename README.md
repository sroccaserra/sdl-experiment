This is an experiment.

The Makefile is an ok Makefile (hopefully).

Filenames are not ok in the usual sense. I deliberately try one or two letter
names to constraint myself to a small codebase. As soon as it grows, I should
lose track of where is what and have to shrink the code until I know where
everything is again.

Also, entry & exit are in the first file, `a.c`. Then `b.c`, etc. should be
down in abstraction.
